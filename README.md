# Translations

This is the repo for the Translations course on Qt Academy.

## Getting Started

The files provided are the demo apps created during the course. They provide a reference for the workflows covered in the course section.

## Instructions

To get started with this project, you will need to have Qt installed from the qt.io website. We Recommend using the QtCreator IDE in order to follow along with the content in the videos.

Translations_Section2: Example to demonstrate how to mark strings for translations with qsTr()

Translations_Section3: Example to demonstrate how to generate .ts files using lupdate. Tested with with Qt 6.7.2 MinGW 64-bit.

Translations_Section4: Example to demonstrate how to generate .qm files using lrelease and load them into the application with QTranslator. Tested with with Qt 6.7.2 MinGW 64-bit.

Translations_Section5a: Example to demonstrate how to use the CMake API for translations (using qt_add_translations()). Tested with with Qt 6.7.2 MinGW 64-bit.

Translations_Section5b: Example to demonstrate how to use the CMake API for translations (using qt_add_lupdate() and qt_add_lrelease()). Tested with with Qt 6.7.2 MinGW 64-bit.

Translations_Section6: Example to demonstrate how to prepare the C++ source code for dynamic translations when using a class exposed to QML. Tested with with Qt 6.7.2 MinGW 64-bit.
